# 2 Player Link
## Notes
* Device side acts as server (not host because Device -> Host seems to have more reliable send):
* Device side does all the node calculation for both player ranges.
* Device side streams data to host.
* Host side only sends player and weapon information.
* Destruction triggers (just triggers to apply the destruction pattern remotely) streamed by Device side.
